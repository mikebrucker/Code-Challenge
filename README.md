# Day-17---Code-Challenge-Workshop-Individual
Day 17 - Code Challenge Workshop: Individual


Assignment:

As you move forward in your web development career you will be tasked with code challenges in interviews. This can be given over the phone or screen share, in house whiteboarding or a take home challenge. Whatever the case, you will be asked to showcase your skills and thought process.

For this workshop you will work through a series of code challenges, some of which are commonly used in technical interviews. Keep in mind an interview is generally 30 - 45 min so don’t spend too long on one. Set a timer and attempt each problem for 30 min. Once the timer is up, move on to the next then return to review what you couldn’t finish the first round.

An interviewer may say you can use the language of your choice, for the purpose of this workshop you will only be using JavaScript. Not only is the interviewer wanting to see your programming skills, they want to gauge your ability to think critically. They want to see how your brain works, how you react when faced with roadblock, when do you give up, how easily you get frustrated and other traits. You will be asked to talk through your thought process as you code so they can understand you better. For this workshop, you will comment your code with that thought process. Above each line of code you will explain what it is you’re doing.

If you hit a roadblock and can not complete the problem. Write out what you think you would do next or what you would possibly look up if given the opportunity. Do NOT just google the answers for submission. This workshop is to gain the skills needed for a technical interview. Now is the time to figure out what your strengths are and what you need to review.

Complete the following challenges:

// 1 write a function named stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating '1s' and '0s'. the string should start with a 1. a string with size 6 should return :'101010'. with size 4 should return : '1010'. with size 12 should return : '101010101010'. The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.

// 2 Given a non-negative integer, return an array containing a list of independent digits in reverse order. Example: 348597 => [7,9,5,8,4,3]

// 3 Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two sequence numbers. Below is an example of the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, … Notice the sequence pattern is the sum of the previous two numbers?

0 + 1 = 1 1 + 1 = 2 1 + 2 = 3 2 + 3 = 5 3 + 5 = 8 …

Build a function to illustrate how to get this sequence to output. If you don’t know where to begin start with pseudo code to work through the steps

// 4 Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.
Write a function called checkCoupon to verify that a coupon is valid and not expired. If the coupon is good, return true. Otherwise, return false. A coupon expires at the END of the expiration date. All dates will be passed in as strings in this format: "June 15, 2014"

// 5 Write a function to test whether a given input is a valid email address. For the purposes of this assessment, here is what makes a valid email: At least one letter character at the beginning All characters between the first character and the @ (if any) must be letters, numbers, or underscores There must be an @ character (after the points listed just now) After the @ character, there must be at least one word character (letter, number, or underscore) or hyphen The email must end with at least one set of a dot followed by one or more word characters. The input must NOT be case-sensitive The function should return true or false.
